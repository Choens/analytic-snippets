# Analytic Snippets

This repo is part of the "Analytic Toolbox" series. This is a
collection of snippets intended to improve your life while working on
analytic projects. Initial efforts will focus on R and SQL, which are
my preferred languages. I will eventually include some simple
templates for SPSS and SAS. I am willing to include snippets for ANY
language commonly used by analysts.

## Rationale

Every analysis is different, yet _much_ of what we do as analysts is
the same every single time. Think about your own work. You obtain a
data set. You write some code to analyze it. You write a report.

Rinse. Wash. Repeat.

Several years ago I realized I was wasting an enormous amout of time
building the same basic structures for each project. Unless all of my
data is coming straight out of a database query. I always create a
"data" folder to hold me data extracts. I always create a "report"
folder to contain my LaTeX or Rmd files. I like to have the same
strucuture and sections in each of my files. All boilerplate and all
repetitive. The goal of the "Analytic Toolbox" series, is to provide
as much of this boilerplate as possible.
